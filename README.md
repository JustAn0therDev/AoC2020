# AoC2020
**Advent of Code 2020** solutions in Python

All of the solutions that worked for me written in Python 3. I didn't write this in C# as I normally would because I wanted to get better at the language and learn what features
of it I can use in different ways.

I'll update this repo for as long as I keep solving the challenges that 
are available in the [official website](https://adventofcode.com).
